    <p>Dear (name),</p>
<p>You are required by the Department of Education (DfE) to declare your interest in hosting ITT placements. From 2025 onwards, you must do this in the spring term of each academic year.</p>
<p>You can do this by logging in to our new DfE service, <a href="https://manage-school-placements-pr-1473.test.teacherservices.cloud/schools/00053faf-c28f-47f5-b0a9-a503aa8bb064/placements/multiple">Manage school placements</a>.</p>
<p>The DfE expects accredited providers to use the service to confirm what schools they work with and what placements they should place their candidates on. </p>
<p>A benefit of this service is that ITT providers in your local area to know whether to contact the ITT coordinator at your school.</p>
<p>It takes less than 1 minute to share your preferences, and gives you options to add more details.</p>
<p>It will also help us the DfE have a better understanding of ITT across the country.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, contact us at <a href="">Manage.SchoolPlacements@education.gov.uk</a></p>
<p>Department for Education</p>
