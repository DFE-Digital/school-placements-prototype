    <p>Dear (name),</p>
<p>Weâ€™re asking schools to let us know whether they are hosting placements for trainees doing initial teacher training (ITT).</p>
<p>You can do this by logging in to our new DfE service, <a href="placement-hosting">Manage school placements</a>.</p>
<p>This will allow ITT providers in your local area to know whether to contact the ITT coordinator at your school.</p>
<p>It takes less than 1 minute to share your preferences, and gives you options to add more details.</p>
<p>It will also help us at the Department for Education have a better understanding of ITT across the country.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, contact us at <a href="">Manage.SchoolPlacements@education.gov.uk</a></p>
<p>Department for Education</p>
